This Project is about building AWS EKS Cluster using Terraform.

I have followed it from thois blog https://medium.com/aws-tip/terraform-deploying-an-eks-cluster-412b771fb0ee and thanks to the writer "Michael Cassidy".

I have followed the exact practice and made use of Modules, Locals and Variables for dynamic code.

Let's get started!!!

In this lab let us learn how to use Provisioners in our templaates.

Terraform Provisioners are used for executing scripts or shell commands on a local or remote machine as part of resource creation/deletion.

Task1: Will create the same infrastructure as in the Lab_01

Task2: Will create a SG that allows ssh access to our public instance.

Task3: Will run local provisioners script to modify permission of pemkey file.

Task4: Will run remote provisioners to clone code from terraform public repo.

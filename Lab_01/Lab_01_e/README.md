In this lab we are adding Outputs block.

Terraform output values allow you to export structured data about your resources. You can use this data to configure other parts of your infrastructure with automation tools, or as a data source for another Terraform workspace.

Task1: Add Output Block to Export Attributes of Resources.

Task2: Output Meaningful Data using Static and Dynamic Values.

Task3: Generate Machine-Readable Outputs in JSON.
